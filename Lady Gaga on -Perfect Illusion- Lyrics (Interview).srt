1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
well this song has a lot of meanings for
me I think even the most obvious meaning

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,289
when you first listen to it and when we
were writing it was to create a song

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,689
about how you love is the most
intoxicating powerful drug in the world

4
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:29,489
it can just make you feel so high that
you don't even realize that you're in a

5
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:35,488
relationship that's not really real that
it wasn't really love it all

6
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:41,369
it was just a perfect illusion you know
our modern struggle with a you know

7
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:46,349
human connection when it comes to you
know social media and the sort sort of

8
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:54,058
endless running of images on instagram
and twitter and other social media where

9
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:59,399
were all kind of creating these perfect
illusions of ourselves that were either

10
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,250
trying to keep up with or maybe having
trouble keeping up with other people's

11
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,560
illusions and unable to find what's
authentic in the sea of all of that so

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,590
you know this song is about all of those
things

13
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,979
well Josh worked on guitars and that
happened a little bit later

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,900
kevin was the sort of the brainchild of
the record he really was the one that

15
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:35,129
came up with the concept of illusion and
he came in with these like melodies and

16
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:35,130
lyrics ideas and we sat down and we kind
of tore it into sections and we wrote
came up with the concept of illusion and
he came in with these like melodies and

17
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,129
lyrics ideas and we sat down and we kind
of tore it into sections and we wrote

18
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:46,739
the lyrics and melodies and restructured
of the chorus the sentiment of the

19
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:52,379
chorus and took the song to a new place
it was really important to me that the

20
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,789
song wasn't just about any illusion it
had to be about the one that fires up

21
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,709
the most you know what is the illusion
that people nowadays feel the most kind

22
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:01,710
of knocked down by and you know we
ultimately thought it was the perfect
the most you know what is the illusion
that people nowadays feel the most kind

23
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,509
of knocked down by and you know we
ultimately thought it was the perfect

24
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,969
ones that are just so good that you a
full the hell out of you

25
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,318
flood pops an incredible producer Mark
Ronson you know executive produced the

26
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:23,548
whole album and he's just brilliant and
very generous of imeem I think the

27
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,150
coolest thing about it was being
embraced as a female musician

28
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,688
you know it was just um I was treated so
equally in the studio and it really

29
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:39,150
helped me to you know game even more
confidence and create something i'm

30
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,819
really proud of with my friends

31
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,780
well mark and I have known each other
for almost 10 years so I already knew

32

37
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,469

time it was this secret to him that I

38
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,120
was a big fan so I I like hunted him
down at the samurai show and was like we

43
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,400
wonderful group of people and I'm i was
really lucky every time you finish a

44
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,219
record or you finished writing a song

45
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,158
there's that moment where everyone kind
of looked at each other and goes oh my

46
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:58,078
god thats that's a record that sounds
like a great record and it's a it

47
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,370
there's no it there's no feeling like it
i mean i remember just the other day

48
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:09,209
here's one I was I walked into the
nightclub moth in London to sing perfect

49
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,689
illusion for the first time and I hadn't
seen mark since the song went to number

50
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:18,029
one on iTunes in over 60 countries and I
just walked into the DJ booth and looked

51
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,958
at it and we just stared at each other
for a few seconds and we're just silent

52
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,050
because you know that what do you say
because at the end of the day we're just

53
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,939
two kids from New York we just can't
believe our songs on the

54
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:34,389
radio and I'd also say that did I I'm
made dinner for the guy's a lot at the

55
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,750
studio I would cook and you know at five
o'clock we pour a drink and I go in and

56
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,779
heat up all the food that I would make
in the morning at my place and then

57
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:48,549
bring over and possums little kitchen at
the studio so we would you eat kind of

58
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,370
like a family and eat home-cooked food
and then we would work again late into

59
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,000
the night and I just won't forget that
it was just such an awesome you know

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,170
family feeling it was just a deeper and
it was more emotional it was a little

61
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,879
bit more difficult for a lot more
difficult at times

62
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,589
mark was really great at navigating that
because you know i could be quite

63
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:19,329
emotional at a point trying to get out
lyrics and get out melodies and get out

64
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:23,769
idea that you just try to calm me down
and you know remind me that my

65
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:28,689
perspective of as an artist is important
that I don't try to be anything but

66
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,279
myself and you know having someone to
reaffirm the things that you believe in

67
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,639
is really important and i would also say
that it's even hard now even doing

68
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,110
interviews about this album removed
today is so much harder than doing all

69
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,930
the other interviews about the other
albums i've done before because they're

70
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,870
more concept records and the themes on
them were you know related to fame or

71
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,240
four born this way it was you know more
of a social activism and related to

72
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,589
bullying and acceptance and
individuality and what it's like to grow

73
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:02,590
up then like an outcast and artpop was a
lot more are a conceptual artistic album
bullying and acceptance and
individuality and what it's like to grow

74
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:09,339
up then like an outcast and artpop was a
lot more are a conceptual artistic album

75
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:14,859
and then you have this new one and it's
it's just you know a bunch of songs

76
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:22,300
about my life so as I'm telling each
interviewer about the record I'm delving

77
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,129
into these private stories that are you
know they're just like right at the

78
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:31,509
surface you know especially since i'm
still finishing things up i'm like a I

79
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,670
tell everyone I'm a laugh away from atty

80
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,270
like I could laugh really loud or cry at
you know in a second

81
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,270
